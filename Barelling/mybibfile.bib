abstract = "A set of experimental compression tests were simulated with a 3D finite element (FE) model to evaluate a technique for determination of engineering constants (Young’s moduli and Poisson’s ratios). During the experiments prism specimens of E-glass \{UD\} weave/PET were compressed between parallel platens. The prisms were equipped with four 0°/90° strain gauges. The simulations include friction between prism and platens and measured specimen misalignment. The simulated stress/strain and strain/strain responses are in good agreement with the linear part of the experimental response. The simulations confirm that good estimates of engineering constants can be obtained by proper strain averaging and extrapolation of the non-oscillating last part of the differentiated stress/strain and strain/strain curves.

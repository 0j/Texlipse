During the experiments prism specimens of E-glass \{UD\} weave/PET were compressed between parallel platens. The prisms were equipped with four 0°/90° strain gauges. The simulations include friction between prism and platens and measured specimen misalignment. The simulated stress/strain and strain/strain responses are in good agreement with the linear part of the experimental response. The simulations confirm that good estimates of engineering constants can be obtained by proper strain averaging and extrapolation of the non-oscillating last part of the differentiated stress/strain and strain/strain curves.

abstract = "Axisymmetric compression tests on solid steel (AISI 5120) cylinders under various lubrication conditions and deformation speeds, suggest that the resulting curvatures of the barrels formed fit closely to circular arcs, the raddi of which follow a power law with respect to the true axial compressive stress. The true compressive stress-strain curve obtained from the experimental data shows that of all the lubricants tested the specific forming energy is minimum for a phosphate coat-soap type lubricant. An attempt is made to relate the surface-roughness value to the hoop strain. "

\section{Introduction}

Characterisation of material stiffness parameters of orthotropic materials can
be challenging. In  careful design of wood structures, not only one parameter, but the full
orthotropic set of elastic parameters could be needed \cite{tsoumis1991science},
e.g. for finite-element modelling of wood joints that are locally subjected to a triaxial stress state.
Compressive experiments are considered to be one of the most common method for identifying engineering constants such as Young's
modulus, Poisson's ratio.The general approach is to measure material response
due to applied forces. The procedure is straitforward and easy to perform due to
simplicity of experimental installation and low requrements to speciemen
geometry. Standards such as ASTM \cite{standard1997d143},
\cite{johnson1983compression} are requiring the usage of rectangular prisms for
the compressive testing.
For precious wood material, e.g. archaeological wood, it is frequently better to use cubic samples loaded in compression, 
since the same sample can be loaded elastically by applying load consecutively
in all three directions \cite{ljungdahl2007transverse}.
The precious material can then be saved to a larger extent and the measurements are done on the same sample. 
Disadvantages with compressive testing of cubes compared to tensile testing of dog-bone specimens, 
is that obtaining a pure compressive stress state is more complicated due to
inhomogeneous distribution of applied compression force due to geometrical
imperfections of test specimen \cite{Toftegaard1999849}.
Moreover, barrelling \textit{\color{red}( add the reference to the image of
barreling effect)} formation in compressive loading \cite{oldroyd1966stress},
due to the more or less restrained contact slip on the platens area, makes it difficult to assess the transverse deformations without having to resort to finite element modelling.
The Poisson’s ratios are thus more difficult to obtain directly from the kind of loading. 
Strain field measurements using digital image correlation are often required to
estimate the stiffness parameters accurately \cite{dahl2009planar,
majano2012test, ozyhar2013moisture}.
Additionally, the cylindrical orthotropy and curvature of the annual rings make the stress field even more non-uniform for large specimens. 
For too small specimens, the tested volume might not be representative, leading to a large scatter in measured stiffness. 
Nevertheless, compressive testing of wooden cubes is the reasonable choice of test method if the amount of available material is limited. 
Such problem arises when archaeological material is tetsted.
The elastic, ultimate and also creep properties of the \textit{Vasa} oak are
needed in stress analysis and design of improved support structure for the ship. 
The waterlogged Vasa oak has been impregnated with polyethylene glycol (PEG) to prevent cracking and deformation during drying. 
Both the aging \cite{bjurhager2012state} and the PEG impregnation
\cite{ljungdahl2007transverse} affect the mechanical properties.



Simulations of experiments in compression are not new. Previously compressive
experiments on prism samples with orthotropic material behavior were simulated
by \cite{Toftegaard1999849} in order to investigate the effect of geometrical imperfections on identification of engineering constants. 
He compared the simulated strain field to the measurements of strain gauges. 
Present work uses DSP in order to obtain the experimental strain field, which
contains strain data of observed area and not between two points as it is for the strain gauge. 
Chen \cite{Chen001} has simulated the behaviour of the specimen with geometrical
imperfections on a locked  seat during the compressive experiments
of composite materials. This is happening when platens of universal testing
machine (UTM) are locked and not automatically adjusted to sample geometry.
When a prism specimen is compressed between platens it contracts transversely.
Its surfaces bear heterogenious deformation that are resulting in barrelling
formation of the prism. 

%The purpose of experiment



Present work focuses on an investigation of
barrelling formation on two different mechanical types of materials. Additionally a comparison of three measuring techniques was made in order to identify the magnitude of error.

\section{Materials and Methods}

\begin{description}
\item{\textit{Experiment}}
\end{description}

An Instron universal testing machine with 100 kN load cell was
used to carry out static tests. Initial tests were conducted on dummy wood specimens in order to find the approximate elastic loading range for all specimen orientations. 
The conventional way to measure strains is by using the built in measurement
system or strain gages. Nowadays, full field strain measurement techniques such
as digital speckle photography (DSP) \cite{synnergren1999stereoscopic} or
3D/stereo-digital image correlation (DIC) \cite{majano2012test} are used more
and more. The strain measurement using DIC has shown a good performance in
comparison to the traditional strain gauges \cite{huang2010optical},
\cite{xavier2012stereovision}. In our case, full-field displacements were observed with a digital-image correlation (DIC) equipment GOM Aramis stereo system 5M.
The distance to the measured object was 300 mm. Surface of specimen was spray
painted with speckles for better contrast. The applied force values were continuously recorded by the DIC system during testing, and stored together with the sampled images. The displacement rate was 0.5 mm per minute. 
The ambient conditions were $23\,^{\circ}{\rm C}$ and 51\% relative humidity.
All tests were performed without delay after the samples were removed from the conditioning storage container, so that the moisture content would essentially be the same as after conditioning. The measurement sampling frequency was 1 Hz. 
Every frame that was recorded by the DIC system was compared with the undeformed state in order to calculate the displacement and strain fields. 
The total surface area of interest used in image analysis was a centred square
of 625 $mm^\textsuperscript{2}$, where a uniform deformation field was found.
The chosen surface area of interest is marked by the dashed lin in Figure
\ref{fig:experimenta}. The acquired strain fields were smoothed by averaging of
each data pixel with $3\times3$ surrounding pixels. The strains determined by
DIC in the loading direction was plotted against the applied stress, see Figure \ref{fig:experimentb}.
Poisson's ratios $\nu_{ij}$ for all corresponding orthotropic planes were
calculated as a negative ratio between the average transverse $\varepsilon_{jj}$
(passive) and normal $\varepsilon_{ii}$ (compressive and active) strains.
The average transverse and normal strains measured along with normal ones were acquired with DIC technique.

The finite element program COMSOL Multiphysics 4.4 \cite{Comsol} was used for
the experimental simulations.
A cube (Figure \ref{fig:Barrelling})  with unit dimensions was modeled with
3D solid elements.
The platens of universal testing machine were not included in the model.
Instead, the compressive loading was simulated as a downward vertical prescribed
displacement. The magnitude of this prescribed displacement was set to 0.01
which corresponds to  1\%  of  strain respectively.

\textit{\color{red} I would put a decent picture that visually shows the
boundary conditions if possible. That is much easier to understand. Or you can
put a picture where you give names or letters to the sidees of the cube and mention the boundary conditions in formulas.}

A \textit{Free Quad} mesh was placed on a top surface and swept throughout
the whole geometry using \textit{Quadrilateral} meshing method which generates
hexahedrons. We have solved the model using different number of FE. 
After a mesh refinement study, a $10\times10\times10$ mesh of quadratic
elements was determined to provide reasonably accurate results for the purpose of this study.

\begin{description}
\item[{\color {red}Friction}]
\end{description}

The friction between platens and specimen is the main reason for the
barrelling formation \cite{Narayanasamy198821, kulkarni1969}.  To simulate that
friction we have introduced friction parameters that were applied to the mutually orthogonal
edges on the top and the bottom surface of the cube. 

\textit{\color {red}Add the picture that is showing the axises and add the
description to the the text in accordance to that. Add the bottom surface, the
free edges the friction, the coefficients, the variability of frictions that }



\begin{description}
\item[{\color {red}Material input parameters}]
\end{description}
We simulated orthotropic, transverse isotropic and isotropic material behaviour.
The model was linear elastic. For the isotropic material stiffness \textit{E}
has a unity value and Poisson's ratio $\nu = 0,3$. For transverse isotropic
material the stiffness parameters were taken as engineering notation of
compliance matrix. For simplification the stiffness coefficients $E_{3}$ and
$E_{1} = E_{2} = E_{3}/a$, where \textit{a} varies from 1 (isotropy) to 10
(transverse isotropy).
\\The same was done for the Poisson's ratio and shear
modulus.


\begin{description}
\item[{\color {red} Strain measuring methods}]
\end{description}

Three strain measuring cases were simulated and results were compared, see 
Figure \ref{fig:expmethods}.
In the \textit{first} case,  the average of the total strain from the surface was taken and used as a value
for obtaining axial stiffness $E_1$. In the \textit{second} experimental method
 50\% of cube surface (Figure \ref{fig:cubemesh}b) was used to calculate the
 average strain. The area was chosen in order to disregard the ``clamping''
 effect on strain field of the surface of the cube. Finally the \textit{third}
 method was based on EN code. \\
 \textit{\color {red} Add the European code to the reference}
The strain is measured between two points on the cube surface as it with strain
gauge.

	\begin{enumerate}
	\color{black}
		\item Barellling formation is less in transverse isotropic and orthotropic
		material.
		\item The larger the Poissonï¿½s ratio in isotropic materials, the more severe
		the barrelling.
		\item Barelling effect does not significant for the transverse isotropic
		material
		\item 3 measuring methods were compared {\color{red} add the plots}

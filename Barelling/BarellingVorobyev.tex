\section{Model}

The finite element program COMSOL Multiphysics 4.4 \cite{Comsol} was used for
the experimental simulations.
The entire cube (Figure \ref{fig:cubemesh})  with singular side was modeled with
3D solid elements.
The platens of universal testing machine were not considered in the model.
Instead compressive load was simulated as prescribed displacement and normally
applied to the top surface of the cube.
The bottom surface was constrained from the displacement along
\textit{Z} axis. However mutually perpendicular edges of the bottom and top
surfaces were aloud to move in its perpendicular directions along \textit{X} and
\textit{Y} axises respectively.

A \textit{\color {red}Add the type of mesh} mesh
was placed on a top surface and \textit{\color{red}swapped} throughout
the whole geometry.
In order to identify the effect of number of finite elements a mesh refining procedures
have been performed.
{\textit{\color {red}Add the mesh refining plot from comsol to the paper}}

\begin{description}
\item[{\color {red}Material input parameters}]
\end{description}
We simulated orthotropic, transverse isotropic and isotropic material behaviour.
The model was linear elastic. 

\begin{description}
\item[{\color {red}Conclusions for the model}]
\end{description}

Simulations of experiments in compression are not new. Previously the
orthotropic samples were simulated by \cite{Toftegaard1999849} in order to investigate the effect of
geometrical imperfections of prism samples on identification of engineering
constants by simulating the strain field in relation to the measurements
obtained using the strain gauge. 
Present work uses DSP in order to obtain the experimental strain field, which
contains strain data of observed area and not between two points as it is for the strain gauge. 
Another simulation was performed by \cite{Chen001}.
He has simulated the behaviour of the specimen with geometrical
imperfections on a locked hemispherical seat during the compressive experiments.

\item[{\color {red}Friction}]
\end{description}

The friction between platens and speciemen is consider to be a reason for the
barrelling formation \textit{\color{red} add citations} To simulate the friction
between the platens and the sample we have introduced friction parameters that were applied to the mutually orthogonal
edges on the top and the bottom surface of the cube. Those parameters were
acting as a resistance for displacement variating from zero and up to the value
which equals to the stiffness along \textit{Z} axis of the cube.

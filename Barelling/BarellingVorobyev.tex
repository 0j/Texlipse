\begin{abstract}
For scarce materials, such as archaeological wood, one often resorts to cubic
samples instead of prisms. For these samples barreling formation gives rise to additional difficulties.
Furthermore natural orthotropy, availability and variation between and within
samples make the mechanical characterisation of wood  challenging. 
The primary purpose of the present study is to identify barrelling
formation in cubic samples during compressive experiments. Secondly, to investigate and
compare barrelling formation on isotropic, transversely 
isotropic and orthotropic material parameters. Finally to compare three 
different strain measurement techniques and investigate which is better for quantification 
of mechanical parameters such as Young's moduli and Poisson's ratios.
The measured engineering parameters were normalised and presented as an error
depending on input configuration.
As an example, compressive tests on waterlogged archaeological oak impregnated
with polyethylene glycol (PEG) are discussed.

\section{Introduction}

Characterisation of material stiffness parameters of orthotropic materials can
be challenging. In  careful design of wood structures, not only one parameter, but the full
orthotropic set of elastic parameters is needed \cite{tsoumis1991science},
e.g. for finite-element modelling of wood joints that are locally subjected to a
triaxial stress state. Compressive experiments are considered to be one of the most reliable methods for identifying engineering constants such as Young's moduli and Poisson's
ratios. The general approach is to measure the material response due to applied
forces. The procedure is straighforward and easy to perform due to simplicity of experimental installation and low requirements to specimen
geometry. Standards such as ASTM \cite{standard1997d143,
johnson1983compression} require the usage of rectangular prisms for
the compressive testing along with strain gauges.
For rare materials such as archaeological wood, it is more convenient to use
cubic samples \cite{ljungdahl2007transverse} to save material. 
This enables testing of the same sample several times and in
different directions (radial, tangential, longitudinal) if the loads are
applied within the elastic range.
A disadvantage with compressive testing of cubes compared to tensile testing of
dog-bone specimens, is that it can be complicated to ensure a homogeneous stress state
due to geometrical imperfections of test specimens \cite{Toftegaard1999849}.
Moreover, barrelling formation (Figure \ref{fig:barrelling}) in compressive
loading \cite{oldroyd1966stress}, due to friction between the platens and the
sample, makes it difficult to assess the  deformations.
Consequently, the Poisson's ratios are thus more difficult to obtain directly from this kind
of loading.
The conventional way to measure strains is by using the built in measurement
system or strain gages. Nowadays, full field strain measurement techniques such
as digital speckle photography (DSP) \cite{synnergren1999stereoscopic} or
3D/stereo-digital image correlation (DIC) \cite{majano2012test} are used more
and more. Strain field measurements technique using DIC has shown a good
performance in comparison to the traditional strain gauges
\cite{huang2010optical,xavier2012stereovision} Additionally it helps to
improve the estimation of the stiffness parameters \cite{dahl2009planar,
majano2012test, ozyhar2013moisture}. 
Nevertheless, compressive testing of wooden cubes is the reasonable 
choice of test method if the amount of available material is limited, as is the case for archaeological material.

In 2012, a project with the aim of designing a new support structure for the
archaeological Vasa ship was initiated. The ship was capsized in 1628, and was salvaged in 1961. 
The waterlogged ship was impregnated with polyethylene glycol (PEG) in an extensive conservation process aiming to prevent deformation during drying. 
Extensive research during the last decades have found that the ship suffers from
aggressive chemical degradation. Both the degradation \cite{bjurhager2012state}
and the PEG impregnation \cite{ljungdahl2007transverse} have had a negative effect on the mechanical properties of the ship, which is in need of a better support. In 2012 a project with the aim of 
designing a new support structure for the fragile and soft ship was also initiated. For this task, the elastic, ultimate and creep properties of the 
Vasa oak need to be determined. Due to the limited access to material, cubic samples which can be tested several times is preferred.
In order to verify the results from the compressive experiments the effect of
barrelling was investigated by the simulation using the Finite Element
Modelling (FEM).\\
Previously compressive experiments on prism samples with orthotropic material
behavior were simulated by Toftegaard \cite{Toftegaard1999849} in order to
investigate the effect of geometrical imperfections on identification of engineering constants. 
in his work he compared the simulated strain field to the measurements of strain
gauges and obtained good agreement between the simulated data and experimental
curves.\\
The present work uses DSP in order to obtain the experimental strain field,
based on the displacements in an area rather than two points using a strain
gauge.
Chen \cite{Chen001} has simulated the behaviour of specimens with geometrical
imperfections on a locked  seat during the compressive experiments
of composite materials. This is relevant when the platens of universal testing
machine (UTM) are locked and cannot adjust to sample geometry.
When a prism specimen is compressed between platens it expand transversely.
Its surfaces bear heterogeneous deformation that are resulting in barreling
formation of the prism. 

%The purpose of experiment



The present work investigates
barrelling formation in three different types of material behaviour.
Additionally three measuring techniques are compared in order to identify the magnitude of
resulting errors.
The results can help to identify the accuracy of the material constants values
of elastic parameters that can be obtained during compressive experiments on
cubic samples.

\item{\textit{Model}}
\end{description}





The finite element program COMSOL Multiphysics 4.4 \cite{Comsol} was used for
the experimental simulations.
A cube with unity dimensions was modeled with
3D solid elements.
The platens of the universal testing machine were not included in the model.
Instead, the compressive loading was simulated as a downward vertical prescribed
displacement. The magnitude of this prescribed displacement was set to 0.01
which corresponds to  1\%  of  strain respectively.
After a mesh refinement study, a $10\times10\times10$ mesh of quadratic brick
elements was determined to provide reasonably accurate results for the purpose of this study.

\end{figure}

The main reason for the barrelling formation is the friction between platens
and specimen \cite{Narayanasamy198821, kulkarni1969}. To simulate the effect of friction, 
we have introduced springs with friction parameters $K$ that partially constrain
lateral displacements on the top and bottom of the cube (Figure
\ref{fig:Barrelling}).
For $K=0$ the displacement of the corresponding edges is fully free
and for increasing $K$ the edges are constrained.

\begin{description}
\item{\textit{Material input parameters}}
\end{description}

Present work investigates isotropic, transversely isotropic and orthotropic
material behavior in combination with linear elasticity.
The material properties that were adopted are listed in
Table \ref{table:simulpar}. Two parameters $a$ and $b$ were introduced for a continuous transition between isotropy and transverse isotropy. 
The first one , $a$, is controlling the stiffness difference between the
longitudinal and transverse directions and the corresponding Poisson's ratio.
The second one, $b$, controls the independent shear modulus based on
observations of shear moduli for materials in Table \ref{table:nonlin}.
The remaining three Poisson's ratios were be obtained from the symmetry
principle relations. The orthotropic material was simulated using input parameters obtained from the experiments \cite{vorobyevcharacterisation}.


\begin{description}
\item{\textit{Strain measuring methods}}
\end{description}


Three strain measuring cases were taken intro account in simulation. The first
case can be considered the same as taking the average dimensional changes of a
sample. In particular the average strain from the total surface area was
obtained and used as a value for obtaining axial stiffness $E_L$. In the
second case, $50\%$ of cube surface (Figure \ref{fig:experiment}) was
used to calculate the average strain. The area was chosen in order to disregard
the constraining effect between the platens of UTM and contact surface of the
cube.
Finally in the third method the strain is measured between two points
in horisontal and two points in vertical direction in the center of the specimen
as it is with the strain gauge based on ASTM code \cite{american2009standard}.

\begin{description}
\item{\textit{Experiment}}
\end{description}

Finally we compare the results to an actual experiment on \textit{Vasa}
material.
An Instron universal testing machine with 100 kN load cell was used to carry out static tests. 
Special care was taken in order to manufacture almost exactly cubic specimens. 
The size of the samples was  $25\times25\times25$ $mm$  The accuracy for
parallelity between the opposite edges of the cube was 0.01 $mm$. 
Initial tests were conducted on dummy wood specimens in order to find the approximate elastic loading range for all specimen orientations.
Full-field displacements were observed with a digital-image correlation (DIC) equipment GOM Aramis stereo system 5M.
The distance to the measured object was 300 mm. The surfaces of specimens was spray
painted with speckles for better contrast. The applied force values were continuously recorded by the DIC system during testing, and stored together with the sampled images. The displacement rate was 0.5 mm per minute. 
The ambient conditions were $23\,^{\circ}{\rm C}$ and 51\% relative humidity.
All tests were performed without delay after the samples were removed from the conditioning storage container, so that the moisture content would essentially be the same as after conditioning. The measurement sampling frequency was 1 Hz. 
Every frame that was recorded by the DIC system was compared with the undeformed state in order to calculate the displacement and in-plane strain field. 
The total surface area of interest used in image analysis was a centred square
of 625 $mm^\textsuperscript{2}$, where a uniform deformation field was found.
The chosen surface area of interest is marked by the dashed line in Figure
\ref{fig:experiment}. The acquired strain fields were smoothed by averaging of
each data pixel with $3\times3$ surrounding pixels in order to avoid the
unwanted artefacts in the measured strain field.
The strains determined by DIC in the loading direction was plotted against the applied stress, see Figure
\ref{fig:explot}. The choice of this area is the subject of a later
discussion in the present paper.
Poisson's ratios $\nu_{ij}$ for all corresponding orthotropic planes were
calculated as the negative ratio between the average transverse
$\varepsilon_{jj}$ (passive) and normal $\varepsilon_{ii}$ (compressive and active) strains.

\section{Results and Discussions}
The simulated strain results were acquired in order to compare those with the
ones in the experiment. The set of experimental and simulations are
compared. The results of the simulations can be used for the
estimation of error that appears due to different strain measurement principles.

\begin{description}
\item{\textit{ Barrelling in Isotropic and Transversely isotropic material}}
\end{description}
The results of the simulation shows that isotropic material barrels
significantly more than transversely isotropic and orthotropic materials. \\	
Three plots can be compared in Figure \ref{fig:isovstriso}. 
From the plots a)-c) one can compare the difference between the measured and actual 
Young's moduli depending on the Poisson's ratio versus the
displacement of the top edge. The displacement is represented as a displacement
factor which is relation between the actual $\delta$ and maximum
displacement $\delta_{max}$ that is based on factor $K$. For all simulations the
barrelling is leading to an overestimation of the Young's moduli. This is caused by the strain field in the area close to the edges, where constrained material has a stiffer response.
In general, for increasing Poisson's ratio, the error becomes larger. 
For the transversely isotropic material in Figure
\ref{fig:isovstriso} $b,c$ the error in Young's moduli is less in
transverse direction $T$ than in the axial direction $L$.
This difefrence in behaviour can be discussed by examining the strain fields for isotropic and 
transversely isotropic materials shown in of Figure
\ref{fig:Error} a, b and c. One can
observe the cones of the constraining effect that are originating from the top
and bottom. The constraining effect is dominant on the $25\%$ of height
from the horisontal edges of the model. Whereas in transversely isotropic
material in the $TT$ plane , the is spread less in the surface area.\\
Observation of Poisson's ratio values showed the opposite behaviour concerning
the measurement.
Figure \ref{fig:isovstriso} $a'$ showed that the relative error for the
Poisson's ratio is less significant in isotropic material. This is supported
with the corresponidng strain field in Figure \ref{fig:Error} $a'$. The normal
Poisson's ratio values are within the central area of the model. 
Alternatively Figure \ref{fig:isovstriso} $b'$ and $c'$ describing the effect
of barreling on the measured materials Poisson's ratio in transversely isotropic material. 
It is seen that for the $LT$ planes the constraining effect influence the
measurements significantly. For example, for the displacement factor $\delta/\delta_{max}\approx0.2 $ where $K=0.1$,  the Poisson's ratio is
underestimated by $30-40\%$.
The same situation is for the plane $TT$ but the effect is less severe.
Referring to Figure \ref{fig:Error} $a-c$  we can see that the constraining effect is
crucial for the estimation of the Poisson's ratio. Blue coloured area where the error is above $5\%$ spreading from the horisontal edges of 
the model throughout the central area of the material. So the most accurate
estimation of Poisson's ratio is in the central area close to the vertical
edges of the cube as it seen in Figure \ref{fig:Error} $c,d$. However it was
mentioned that usage of strain gauges are usually placed in the center of the
specimen, whereas presented results are supporting the fact that central
region of the specimen is not always beneficial for the measurements. In this
case the usage of DIC is preferable. 


\begin{description}
\item{\textit{Strain measurement}}
\end{description}
Measured mechanical properties varies with strain measurement methods. In
present work, three methods were measured and compared. The
first method is shown in Figure \ref{fig:strainmethods}$b$, where the total area
including the constrained region is taken for measuring the strain.  
Here the error originates from the underestimated axial strains that are the
reason of constraining effect of horisontal edges. However the evaluation of
Poisson's ratio has less error due to inclusion of the total area into the
strain evaluations. Strain field in Figure \ref{fig:Error}$b$ shows that total
area has more regions where error is not significant.

In the second approach only the middle 50\% of the area part was
taken for determination of strain. The plot in Figure \ref{fig:strainmethods}$a$
shows that with this method the Young's moduli is less overestimated.\par
  In the last approach where ASTM standard
with strain gauge technique was used, the error is very close to the one in
second approach. The plot in Figure \ref{fig:strainmethods}$c$ depicts that.
This is due to the strain is measured between two points in the center of 
the specimen where the constraining effect is less severe.

\end{figure}

Large error values for the Young's
modulus close to the horizontal edges of isotropic model are clearly visible in
Figure \ref{fig:Error}$a$. The opposite is true for the transversely isotropic
specimen in (Figure \ref{fig:Error} $b,c$), for $LT$ plane 
the Young's moduli in the central area is overestimatedn whereas for $TT$ plane
the strain field looks similar to the isotropic material.\par
These simulations are supporting the experimental results in Figure
\ref{fig:explot}. Where the average strain diagram for the total area is showing larger Young's moduli than
the one for the chosen area.
Additional outcomes are deduced  while observing the error fields in Figure
\ref{fig:Error} $a'-c'$. The ASTM standard \cite{american2009standard} requires
installation of strain gauges in the center of the specimen. This approach will
lead to underestimation of Poisson's ratio in transversely isotropic cubic
specimen due to the barrelling formation. On the other hand accurate values will
be obtained for the isotropic material, where the constraining effect influence
the horizontal edges of the specimen. The central area of the isotropic specimen
is most favourable for accurate measurements.

\section{Conclusions}
Barrelling formation can be well quantified by  FE modelling. strain
identification using the DIC system gives better view on the distribution of
strains and therefore it is possibly easier to identify the distribution of
``clamped'' regions where the barrelling formation appeared. 
In general the mechanical experiments are overestimating the actual values for
the Young's moduli due underestimation of strain. In the case of quantifying the
Poisson's ratio, the DIC measurement has benefits, because the true values of Poisson's ratio are close
to the central part of vertical edges of the specimen and not in the center,
where the strain gauges are usually placed. 
The cubic samples can be used for the mechanical experiments in case of low
availability of material. However strain identification with the help of DIC is
beneficial. It was identified that central position of strain gauges as it
stated in is good for the isotropic materials but leads to a strain
overestimation in transverse isotropic materials.
